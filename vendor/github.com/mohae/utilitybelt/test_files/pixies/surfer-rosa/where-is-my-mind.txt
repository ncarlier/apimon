Oh stop

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse
But there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

Way out in the water
See it swimmin'

I was swimmin' in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rocks
Except the little fish
But they told me, he swears
Tryin' to talk to me, to me, to me

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

Way out in the water
See it swimmin'

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse
IF there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

Way out in the water
See it swimmin'

Oh
With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Oh
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Oh
Oh
