Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distand tide
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you throught the land 
And help me understand the best I can
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
 No one speaks
And no one tries
No one flies around the sun

Cloudless every day you fall upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on the sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no one singe me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you acrosss the sky
